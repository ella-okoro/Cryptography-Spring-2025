# RSA Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
Attached are the source code and the program run output for my RSA implementation. The output, including key generation, encryption, and decryption details, can be found in the "output" folder within the text files: key_generation.txt, encryption.txt, and decryption.txt.

## How to Run
To run the program:
1. Compile and run the Main class.
2. The program will prompt you to enter a message for encryption.
3. After entering the message, the program will generate the encryption and decryption outputs.
4. The results will be saved in the aforementioned text files in the "output" folder.
